### About
In order to flesh out the 'projects' section of my website, and to keep myself busy and learning, I decided to embark on multiple
small projects that wouldn't take long but would still be rewarding. This is the first of those projects.

I wanted to make a web scraper as I am often told that it is a great place to start, and I have also been told the same about Twitter Bots, so 
I thought I would combine the two to create this project.
